        <p>
            I am from Delta State, Nigeria, a region known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant communities. Going for holiday in Delta state has shaped my perspective on design and creativity, inspiring me to incorporate elements of my culture into my work. The diverse landscapes and traditions of Delta continue to influence my approach to web design, making it a unique blend of modern aesthetics and cultural depth.
